Please assess the attached student submission using the provided rubric.

In 3–4 sentences, explain:

What the student did well, referencing specific rubric categories

What the student could improve on to strengthen their work and move toward “Proficient” or “Excellent,” as appropriate

Keep the feedback specific, concise, and grounded in rubric language. Use clear language even when a submission falls below “Proficient,” and assume this feedback will be used to identify themes across submissions for instructional planning.
